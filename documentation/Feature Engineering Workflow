Feature selection process

1. Computed correlation heatmap using target variables of standardized IQ (stand_IQ) and raw IQ (raw_IQ) along with all other features
2. Utilized Top_correlations.py code to print top 10 features correlated with variable of interest
3. Used RFE_nonlinear_featureselection.py to perform recursive feature elimination in order to find balance between reducing multicollinearity and maximizing correlation between features and variables of interest
4. Also tried Lasso_feature_selection.py code to perform Lasso feature selection to better identify features to include
5. Used tensorflow_permutation.py code to shuffle features and calculate permutation importance 
6. Looked through relevant literature on intelligence and brain volume 
7. Combined information derived from all these areas, along with testing different combinations of features in order to determine best performing set of features to use in neural network
